This repository demonstrates a common error in COBOL programs: improper handling of data structures when moving data between different areas. The 'bug.cob' file contains the erroneous code, leading to unexpected results. The corrected version is in 'bugSolution.cob', illustrating proper handling of data structure definitions and movement of data.  The error arises from assumptions about data structure alignment and size.  The solution emphasizes explicit data structure definition.
